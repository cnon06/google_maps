This program uses the MVVM architecture to pull data from Google Cloud and show the places that sell the kind of food you are looking for around 1500 meters from your location. Attention: To access the codes, you can click on the github link in the description of this video. For the program to work properly, you must paste the API Key you obtained from google cloud into the API_KEY String variable in the Constants file in the Lib-Utils folder.
